      <h1>Treatments</h1>
      <h2>Keratin</h2>
      <p>Your hair is made up of keratin, so the Keratin Treatment is putting protein back into the hair, which is often lost due to age and chemical services. It is essentially rebuilding the damaged areas, you can expect to see an increase in shine, less frizz, and an easier styling process overall.</p><img  src="img/perm.png" id="b">
      
      <p>Keratin Blowout...................$70+</p>
      <p>Keratin Treatment...............$125+</p>
     
      <p>If you desire silky straight hair but lack the time to receive a regular Keratin Treatment, then a Keratin Express Blowout is just for you! In less time than a traditional Keratin Treatment, you can have the same beautiful smooth hair for up to six weeks. A regular Keratin Complex Treatment is a longer service but will give lasting results of up to five months and requires a 72-hour waiting period before you can wash your hair.</p>
       
      <h1>Deep Conditioning</h1>
      <p>Deep Conditioning...............$25</p>
      <p>Our Deep Conditioning Treatment penetrates the hair shaft, restoring the natural shine of the hair. Over time your hair gets build up from the environment around you. A deep conditioner smoothes the shaft of the hair to give you back your natural shine. It also helps with dry scalp and can bring dull, lifeless colored and chemically treated hair back to life.</p>
