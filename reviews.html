          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon - Vviolet Oil Moist &amp; Glossifier Leave-in]</p>My son is bi-racial.  His hair always looked dull and dry until I started using Vviolet Oil Moist and Moisture Glossifier Leave-in. Compliments are given to my son about his beautiful curls all the time. People line up to feel his hair and they ask what do I use on his hair. They love the smell and softness of his hair.<p class="review-p">-Kasey</p></li>
          
          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon - Vviolet Products]</p>Vviolet has made my hair feel healthier and my hair is growing.  I love this product.

          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon - Crème of Essence Shampoo]</p>I am a Caucasian female with three bi-racial children.  I didn’t know what to do with their hair because it was curly, straight but very dry.  I was told about the Vviolet Crème of Essence Shampoo, Vviolet Oil Moist and the Vviolet Moisture Glossifier Leave-In Conditioner.  I mixed the Oil Moist and the Moisture Glossifier Leave-In Conditioner together.  I apply this daily.  It made my children happy.  It made me happy.<p class="review-p">-Teresa</p></li>
          
          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon - Hot Oil Treatment]</p>I have always had dry, itchy scalp.  I was advised by a Vviolet Consultant to use the Vviolet Hot Oil Treatment and to drink plenty of water.  I followed her instructions.  I am very happy with the results.<p class="review-p">-Corrine M.</p></li>
          
          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon - Thermal Texturizer System ]</p>I am unable to wear chemical services, so my hair stylist introduced me to the Thermal Texturizer System (Hollywood Press).  My hair lasts until my next salon visit.  Everyone thinks I have a chemical relaxer.<p class="review-p">-Becky Jackson</p></li>
          
          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon -Vviolet Products]</p> In 1999, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  All of my hair began to shed from the treatments.  As my hair was growing back, I started using the Vviolet Therapeutic Shampoo, Vviolet’s Growth Crème Reconstructor and the Medicated Hair &amp; Scalp Oil.  My hair is relaxed with the Vviolet Relaxer System.  My cancer returned in 2003.  I have not had any abnormal shedding.   As of December 2006, my hair is healthy, shiny, and bouncy.    Thank you God I’m cancer free! And, thank you Vviolet, my hair looks great!<p class="review-p">-Felecia</p></li>
          
          <li class="review-li"><p>[Vviolet Hair Salon - Therapeutic Shampoo]</p>Love that Vviolet Therapeutic Shampoo! <p class="review-p">-Attorney Fields</p></li>
