# Vviolet-Hair-Salon
This is a website for Vviolet Hair Salon, which is located in Jackson, TN. The website is to inform customers about the services that the salon provides. This website could also be used to create a personal relationship with customers.

Overview:
Hello! This project was created by Ashlyn Emerson and Greer Pirtle. 
It was very intriguing to create a website for a business on our own. 
During the time we worked on the website, we got along very well and had fun while completing it!
Together we have gained a lot of new skills on building a website and the different properties involved in its creation.
Our website is a great demonstration of how we applied our skills and worked as a team.


Home Page:
We began by choosing a color scheme that would complement the logo of the hair salon. We also decided to give some information about Vviolet Hair Salon and provided visuals for the customer or reader to see the top-notch qualities of Vviolet Hair Salon.


About Page:
In our opinion, the about page was the easiest page to create. On this page we discussed the history of the business and its founder. 
We also discussed product development and distribution to other states.


Services Page:
The services page gives the reader information on the different kinds of hair treatments they can receive and how they can expect to pay. 
There is also a brief description of each type of service that is provided.


Products Page:
The products page was more difficult than the other pages. Our reasoning behind this is because we had to challenge ourselves by incorporating various attributes such as: ids, media queries, and text-alignment.


Reviews Page:
The reviews page was fairly interesting because we learned a lot about how people respond to Vviolet Hair Care Products. Many personalities are shown through these reviews and comments. We really enjoyed reading and making this page.


Contact Page:
The contact page consists of ways the customer can contact Vviolet Hair Salon. They can also fill out the form to ask questions or simply leave a review. Also, by clicking the map or the link you can receive turn-by-turn directions.


FAQS Page:
We made sure this page involved an abundant amount of questions that we thought the customer would like answered. We divided this page into sections so the customer can easily locate the information they are looking for.
